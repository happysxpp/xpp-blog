Close my eyes and feel your mind  
Time has passed  
I walk like a shadow  
Never knew  
What I am going through  
You touch my heart  
And take my breath away

Whisper on the wind so softly  
Let the bright stars fill our dreams with love  
Reach for your hand (you're holding my key)  
And you show me the way

Tonight, I feel close to you  
You open my door and light the sky above  
When I need a friend, you are there right by my side  
I wish we could stay as one  
I wish we could stay forever as one

All the tears that haunt my past  
You promised it'll be better tomorrow  
Play that song you and I listened to  
And let it gently ease our pain  
Tender rain drops from the blue sky (blue sky)  
Flowers blooming, life is so divine  
Like sunlight on a stream (you're holding my key)  
You show the world to me

Tonight, I feel close to you  
You open my door and light the sky above  
When I need a friend, you are there right by my side  
I wish we could stay as one

So much love in this beautiful world  
Search for the brightest star in the sky  
You will find the meaning of love  
Don't be afraid (don't be afraid)  
Just be yourself (just be yourself)  
We need this love (we need this love)  
I've never knew (I've never knew)

Tonight, I feel close to you  
You open my door and light the sky above  
When I need a friend, you are there right by my side  
I wish we could stay as one

Tonight, I feel close to you  
You open my door and light the sky above  
When I need a friend, you are there right by my side  
I wish we could stay as one  
I wish we could stay forever as one
