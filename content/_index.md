**Hello ~** 

I am a  master's student major in CS in the College of Computer and Information Science at [Southwest University](http://www.swu.edu.cn/), Chongqing, China. Advised by both [Prof. Guoqiang Xiao](http://cis.swu.edu.cn/info/1013/1150.htm) and [Prof. Xianfeng Han.](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4FaCTFgAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao)

## Research

Currently, I am focusing on the following topics.

1. **3D Reconstruction**:  
   
   

2. **3D Scene Representation**
   
	> My goal is to allow independent agents to reason about our world given visual observations, such as inferring a complete model of a scene with information on geometry, material, lighting etc. from only few observations, a task that is simple for humans, but currently impossible for AI. - Vincent Sitzmann
